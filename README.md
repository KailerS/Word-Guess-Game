# Word-Guess-Game
A game that lets users guess from a predetermined list of current MLB players. It uses the keys that users press and checks them against the word in play. When a letter is guessed it goes either into the word or a list of letters already guessed. When the user has zero guesses left it starts over and selects a new word. When the correct player's last name is guessed their picture will be displayed.
